MUST see about TZ for CUU ELP

scroll to selected row on save
make a copy button that works like new but takes fields
99 becomes 0+99, wtf .. also make it so I can type 300m and it will be 6+00, 3h -> 3+00, 300 should become 3+00
find a way to keep row selected during refresh
make views
write difftime db function
utc/local time weird if no date
inserts that fail do to unique constraints fail silently and the table acts buggy thereafter
do something about all the times in the flights table
fix the airport data
allow multiline approach editing - or use CSV
adjust airports select queries
fix column sorting
make fkey fields indicate if they will cause an insert
