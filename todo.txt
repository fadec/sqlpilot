MUST see about TZ for CUU ELP

scroll to selected row on save - this currently scrolls to cursor and does not work for new inserts. It works on rows clicked on to select them.
make a copy button that works like new but takes fields
find a way to keep row selected during refresh
make views
write difftime db function
utc/local time weird if no date

** inserts that fail do to unique constraints fail silently and the table acts buggy thereafter
   make edctrl stuck in invalid state until told to exit
							
fix the airport data					
allow multiline approach editing - or use CSV		
adjust airports select queries				
fix column sorting					
After save/creation, a row remains visible or appears even if it doesn't match the where clause. This is a feature but there should be an indication that a row is not in the where.
Make importcsv read row headers, output date/airport pair to stdout, and take options for timebase of local|airport|utc|specified
Make leg seq adjustments to other rows if one is changed. Allow drag row within a date.  							
Casts to null/"" of 0+00 ruins gui sorting for num. -0+00 is not handled correctly in sort.
