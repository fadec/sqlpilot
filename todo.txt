 - time of day fields aout and sout become datetimes
 - added sequence number (Flights.Seq) for flights on a date
 - Flights.Date will no longer be associated with aout or sout and will not change with out times, it's a duty date
 - date, seq, other flights on a given date will be used to determine correct date for local and utc out times
 - added trip date (Flights.TripDate) for grouping of flights into trips

make multiline text also make modified
scroll to selected row on save
make a copy button that works like new but takes fields
stop changed signals from triggering modified state for utc/local switch
99 becomes 0+99, wtf .. also make it so I can type 300m and it will be 6+00, 3h -> 3+00, 300 should become 3+00
funky thing happens with date and time entry around midnight and switching utc-local. it seems to step backwards
find a way to keep row selected during refresh
make views
write difftime db function
make notes display an indication on table view if present
remove cancel button
make deletes more difficult
allow .5 in elapsed time fields to become 0+30
make time be smart where 1000l = 10:00 local and 1000u = 10:00 UTC
fix update and delete buttons so they only work if it makes sence
inserts that fail do to unique constraints fail silently and the table acts buggy thereafter
do something about all the times in the flights table
fix the airport data
allow multiline approach editing
adjust airports select queries
fix column sorting
make fkey fields indicate if they will cause an insert
